**God exist or not ?** It is one of the fundamental questions of **Philosophy**. Many people have strong views about God and whether God exist. In case of such issues like, God and existence of God, thoughts of people are emotionally driven, hence they are politicized. That is why we cannot think about it clearly. But Philosophy is all about trying to think clearly about issues that are often highly politicized and emotional. So it would be better to have a proof on the existence of God.

There are many arguments on God and existence of God. One of the most popular argument is **Anselm’s Ontological Argument**. Saint Anselm came up with an argument, he thought with this argument he can prove the existence of God. Anselm’s Ontological argument was based on **two** main ideas.

His first idea was on **what actually God is or what it means to be God**.

According to Anselm
>God is something than that which no greater can be thought.

What it means that when we think about God, we are thinking of a maximally good thing, a thing such that no better cannot be thought.

His second idea was on **the existence and non existence of God**. According to Anselm there are things that exist in our understanding (**e.g.** Tooth Fairy). The things that we can think of. And there are things that exist in reality (**e.g.** Computer). There maybe some intersections between our understanding and reality. That means there are things that exist both in reality and in our understanding.

Anselm claimed that if things that exist in our understanding also exist in reality would have greater value. For example if we think about tooth fairy it is pretty good, but if it also exist in reality it would be awesome. Now if we think about God, God is something than which no greater can be thought. So, Let us assume God exist only in our understanding, who is maximally Good. But we already showed that if something exist both in reality and in our understanding that would have greater value. But God cannot be better than we have in our understanding, because he is already maximally good. So from here we can conclude God cannot exist only in our understanding, he must also exist in reality.

So this was the key idea of Anselm’s ontological argument. Though it seems pretty convincing, it is was criticised by many other philosophers. **Monk Gaunilo** argued that by this kind of argument we can show anything extreme whether it is good or bad, if it exist in our understanding, must also exist in reality. So, there must be some fault in this type of argument. This does not mean it proves God does not exist. We just tried to analyze Anselm’s ontological argument and have a clear view on it. There are other arguments which also argues about existence of God. And this is what Philosophy do, it  is all about trying to think clearly about issues that are often highly politicized and emotional.

Anyway, If Anselm’s Ontological argument was true then we can prove the existence of Superman. Let’s try it ….

Superman is a fictional character from DC Comics, which exist in our understanding. Whether you were introduced to superman from comics or from Hollywood movie series, you may already know he is one of the ( or Only one .. Have you watched **Justice League** ? ) mightiest one from all other comic Superheroes. Now if he also exist in reality, what would be the situation ? He would have greater value than when he only exist in our understanding. But how is it possible ? We have already claimed He is one of the mightiest one or arguably the mightiest from all other Superheroes, then it is not logically possible to exist only in our understanding, He must also exist in our reality.

Now when we have proved Superman exist, Question arises who is that mighty guy, right ? Simple It’s me, atleast I love to think So ! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
